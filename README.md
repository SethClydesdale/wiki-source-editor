# Wiki Source Editor

Wiki Source Editor is a web application that allows you to view and edit the source code of any public wiki on Github. More importantly, it allows you to share your modifications with others, so that you can collaborate on a wiki together.

## How to Use

Wiki Source Editor is a web application, so you can use it locally or online. Currently it's hosted in this repository, so you can use it by visiting the link below.

It's split into three simple steps ; Get a Wiki, Choose a Page, and View/Edit/Share. I'll go into more depth once I finish setting everything up, but if you have any questions let me know.
