# Wiki Source Editor

Wiki Source Editor is a tool that allows you to view and edit the source code of any public wiki on Github. More importantly, it gives you the ability to share your modifications with others, so that you can collaborate on a wiki together.

## How to Use

You can use this tool locally or online. Currently it's hosted in this repository, so you can use it by visiting the link below.

It's split into three simple steps ; Get a Wiki, Choose a Page, and View/Edit/Share. I'll go into more depth once I finish setting everything up, but if you have any questions let me know.
